## Ryan Crispin Heneise

### Ruby on Rails developer and startup founder

*Austin, Texas Metropolitan Area*

I help businesses launch amazing web apps. My clients launch top-quality MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) earlier, save money on product development, and get their first customers sooner. 

I help reduce your risk by building the smallest version possible to get the job done, then experiment in-market to help get your first customers as quickly as possible.

### HOW I DO IT: 

I‚Äôll get your product to market fast using the latest advances in Ruby on Rails and our proprietary Launchpad app template and code library. We'll launch your MVP in three weeks, and then iterate until your product is ready to launch. This minimizes waste and puts you in control of your timeline and your budget. 

Reducing your risk is vital. One of the ways we do this is by structuring our pricing around the Lean methodology. 

Working in a series of sprints, each sprint is billed separately. This gives you control over your spending and the velocity of your project. 

### WHO I WORK WITH: 
My clients are startups and businesses launching a new web-based product. If you‚Äôre ready to launch a new web-based app, talk to me first. I love giving free advice, even if we don‚Äôt end up working together. 

### WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING:
‚ÄúBooster Stage has been a great investment for BeOnAlert, helping us get a working product ready for initial release and testing with Beta customers in just a few short weeks.‚Äù ‚ÄîDiane Strutner, BeOnAlert.com

### MY BACKGROUND: 
I‚Äôve been developing web applications professionally for over 14 years for clients of all sizes. In 2008 I launched Donor Tools, a SaaS business to help nonprofits keep track of donations and raise more money online. Years of building and launching new SaaS apps has given me insight into the perils and pitfalls faced by startups and established businesses alike when creating a new web-based product. My latest venture, Booster Stage, is my way of helping founders to avoid the mistakes that can sink a new product, and steer them toward success.
